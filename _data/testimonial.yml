  "Aidan and Charlie from AC Lensworks produced our TV commercial for Viking Television (VTV). 
  The process was creative, efficient and effective in meeting our goals for the desired representation of our business. 
  AC Lensworks arrived on time, consulted with us throughout the process and took a wide variety of shots to give them options in the final edit.
  The finished product exceeded our expectations. 
  AC Lensworks was able to accurately capture the three major facets of our business (retail, repairs and lessons) in a clear and succinct manner. 
  The production was slick with great detailed shots of the shop. 
  The final result was a professional level commercial that has helped immensely in spreading the word about our business locally. 
  Hidden Gem Guitars highly recommends AC Lensworks!"
